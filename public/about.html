<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello World! I'm a software developer who loves bringing ideas to life with code. I've built many projects from backend systems in Python and Django to desktop apps in C#, and I enjoy adding a little extra with HTML and CSS. Previously, I worked as a STEM tutor, helping students tackle tough problems has really sharpened my problem-solving skills and taught me how to break down complex concepts into something clear and approachable. Now I apply the same mindset to build thoughtful, user-friendly applications.</p>

<p>One of the best parts of my life is Athena, my sweet and spirited dog. She's not only my daily adventure buddy but also a registered therapy dog with Paws for Friendship. Together, we visit hospitals, nursing homes, libraries, museums, and much more to bring comfort and joy to those in need. Athena has a natural gift for lifting spirits - her hugs, kisses, and wagging tail have a way of making people smile instantly.</p>

<p>Outside of coding and volunteering, I love spending my time playing piano, hitting the beach, hanging out with friends, and taking Athena on little adventures around town. Whether it's splashing at the dog water park, hiking around town, or just relaxing by the ocean, I find inspiration in simple moments.</p>
